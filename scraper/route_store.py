"""Route searches as first-class rows, and where listings sit relative to them.

A route search is not a new kind of search. It is one buyer intent expressed as
several ordinary searches — one per circle covering the corridor — and the rest
of the system already knows how to run those. So this module writes into the
existing `searches` table rather than beside it, and everything downstream
(scraping, extraction, scoring) keeps working without knowing a route exists.

Two things do need somewhere to live:

- the route itself, so a corridor can be re-planned or re-drawn without asking
  the routing service again, and so the circles can be traced back to the intent
  that produced them;
- where each listing sits relative to that route. The detour is a property of
  (listing, route), not of the listing, so it belongs in its own table for the
  same reason fact sheets do: one listing on two routes has two detours, and
  neither is a fact about the listing.

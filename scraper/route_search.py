"""Turning one search into a corridor of searches along a route.

A platform search is anchored to a single place. This module takes an ordinary
search URL, a route, and how far off it a buyer will turn, and produces the small
set of searches whose circles cover that corridor.

Three measured facts shape the implementation, and each of them removes work:

1. The radius in the URL is a free parameter, not one of the values the site's
   own dropdown offers. `r17` is served exactly as readily as `r25`. That means a
   circle can be sized to the geometry instead of the geometry being bent to fit
   a dropdown.
2. Only the trailing `k…c…l…r…` segment decides what is searched. A request for
   `/s-hamburg/brimnes/k0l13533r17` returns Inning results and renders "in Inning
   am Ammersee" — the readable path is decoration. So rewriting touches the tail
   and nothing else, which keeps this working for category URLs, price filters
   and keyword URLs alike without knowing which is which.
3. Place names and postal codes resolve to location ids through the site's own
   suggestion endpoint, so a centre computed as coordinates can be expressed as
   a search.

Because a centre must land on a real place, each ideal centre is snapped to the
nearest postal code, which moves it by a few kilometres. Rather than pretend the
gap away, each circle is widened by its own snap distance — affordable precisely
because of fact 1, and per circle so that one centre landing in a lake cannot
inflate the whole corridor.

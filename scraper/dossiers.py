"""Model dossiers: product knowledge that is not in the listing.

A seller never writes that their engine has a known timing-chain weakness. That
knowledge exists publicly, but it is per *model*, not per listing — which is what
makes it affordable. One dossier is researched once and then applies to every
listing of that model, so the most expensive component in the system is also the
best amortised.

Two rules hold this together and are enforced here rather than left to prompt
wording:

1. Every claim carries a source and a date. A claim without a source is dropped,
   not softened — a model asserting engine failures from memory is a liability.
2. Claims expire on their own clock. A construction weakness is stable for years;
   a price band is stale in days. A single TTL for both would be either wasteful
   or wrong.

A dossier's payoff is `check_fields`: extra extraction fields, in the same shape
as playbook fields, that only make sense for this model. They extend the category
fact sheet for matching listings and stay buyer-independent.

or bulletin number without a URL is not a source and the claim will be discarded. \
If you cannot supply a URL, omit the claim entirely — an unsourced claim is worse \
than a missing one, because it will be applied to thousands of listings.

return an empty claims array rather than plausible-looking citations.

Concentrate on what a seller would not volunteer:
- known construction weaknesses and the mileage or age at which they appear
- manufacturer recalls and goodwill programmes
- maintenance that is due at a predictable point and is expensive when skipped
- what distinguishes a well-kept example from a neglected one in this model

Then derive the checks a buyer should apply to a listing. Each check must be \
answerable from a listing text alone.

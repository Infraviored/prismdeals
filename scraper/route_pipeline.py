"""Running a route search end to end.

Two operations, deliberately separate because they happen at different times and
cost different things:

`create` plans a corridor and registers its circles as ordinary searches. It runs
once, when a buyer says where they are driving. Everything after that is the
existing pipeline: the scraper collects those searches like any other, the
extractor builds fact sheets, the scorer ranks against intent.

`annotate` computes what the ordinary pipeline cannot know — how far off the route
each listing sits, and what collecting it would cost in driving time. It runs
after scraping, over listings that do not have an answer yet, so a route with a
thousand listings does not re-route the ones it settled yesterday.

Keeping them apart is what stops the routing service from ever sitting in the
scraper's path: if routing is down, listings still arrive, they simply arrive
without a detour until the next annotate run.

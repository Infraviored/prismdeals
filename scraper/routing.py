"""Routes and detours, via OSRM.

The number this module exists to produce is the detour: how much longer the trip
becomes if a listing is collected on the way.

    detour = drive(A -> listing -> B) - drive(A -> B)

Straight-line distance cannot answer that. A wardrobe five kilometres off the
motorway down a dead-end lane costs ten kilometres and a turnaround; one fifteen
kilometres away but on the road already being driven costs almost nothing. For a
bulky, cheap item the detour is a large part of the real price, which is why it
belongs beside the score rather than behind a filter.

The detour is computed locally, between two anchors that bracket the listing's
nearest point on the route, not by re-routing the whole journey per listing. Both
give the same answer whenever the listing is genuinely near the corridor — the
untouched parts of the route cancel in the subtraction — and the local form keeps
each listing to one short request instead of one long one.

Only the half with the listing in it is a request. What the same stretch costs
without the listing is read off the route's own per-segment durations, which both
halves the requests and, more importantly, keeps the comparison honest: a routing
service asked for the time between two points answers with the best way between
them, and on a there-and-back trip that is not the way the driver is going.

    For an ordinary journey from A to B that is exactly `drive(A -> point -> B)
    minus drive(A -> B)`: one request per listing, against the whole trip, which
    is the definition and what a driver comparing this against their phone sees.

    An earlier version measured it locally instead, between anchors fifteen
    kilometres either side of the listing, feeding the route's own vertices back
    in as waypoints so both halves described the same path. It over-reported,
    badly:

        Friedrichshafen     140 min      actual  15 min
        Bermatingen         153 min      actual  37 min
        Ueberlingen          85 min      actual  19 min

    Two mistakes compounded. Forcing the route's vertices back in turns any
    diversion into an out-and-back from the nearest route point, when a driver
    would leave earlier and rejoin later. And the fifteen-kilometre bracket
    forbids exactly that: around Lake Constance, rejoining within fifteen
    kilometres means driving round the lake and back, which is how a
    fifteen-minute stop came to cost two hours. Dropping the waypoints alone
    fixed the inland cases exactly -- Huglfing 97 against 97, Peissenberg 86
    against 86 -- and left the lake ones as wrong, because the bracket was the
    other half of it.

    What the waypoints were right about is kept, in the smallest form that
    works. A journey that doubles back has the same start and end, so
    `drive(A -> point -> A)` is free to skip the far end of it entirely and the
    subtraction goes negative. Only the turnarounds are therefore passed back to
    the router -- the points that carry the route's shape. An ordinary A-to-B
    route has none of them, and the call is the plain three-point one.
